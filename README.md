The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that detects and classifies various lung diseases by using 5-second audio recordings of lung sounds. These diseases are:
+ Asthma
+ Pneumonia
+ COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)
+ Bronchitis
+ Heart Failure
+ Lung Fibrosis
+ Pleural Effusion
